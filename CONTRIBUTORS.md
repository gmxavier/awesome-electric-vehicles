# Contributor Guidelines

Hi there! I'm very delighted you would like to contribute, considering research isn't an easy task.
I value your dedication and commitment.

***So, please follow the guidelines before submitting a pull request:***

--- 

- Check for any duplicated resources.
- Make sure the resource is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and a good succinct description in a big picture.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- ***Follow the already applied style/format.*** Note that it might vary for different sections.
- Always check your typos/spelling and grammar.
- The pull requests and commits should have a good title. For example., ***'Added xxx in xxx section'.***
- Before/After your contribution, please make sure all your added links are indeed working.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

**To sum up,** please remember that every contribution no matter how **small**, is highly appreciated and encouraged as it helps gather all the resources in one place for EV enthusiasts like yourself!


_I will then personally review the content and initiate a merge. Thanks!_
