## Hardware Technology
> ***Revolutionary and advancing tech in EV industry you may ask?***

### Supercapacitors

In short, supercaps are high-capacity capacitors. They have higher capacitance and lower voltage limits than other types of capacitors, and functionally, they lie somewhere in between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries.
