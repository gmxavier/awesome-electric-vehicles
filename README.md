## Hardware Technology
> ***Revolutionary and advancing tech in EV industry you may ask?***

### Supercapacitors

In short, supercaps are high-capacity capacitors. They have higher capacitance and lower voltage limits than other types of capacitors, and functionally, they lie somewhere in between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries.

[**:hearts: Supercaps Vs. Batteries**](https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/supercapacitor-vs-battery-ultracapacitor-pros-and-cons) &nbsp; [**:hearts: How they work?**](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/19/will-supercapacitors-ever-replace-batteries/) &nbsp; [**:hearts: Regen supercaps**](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2013/08/130821-supercapacitors/) &nbsp; [**:hearts: Lamborghini's powerful supercap**](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1124923_lamborghini-uses-supercapacitors-in-its-most-powerful-car-ever) &nbsp; [**:hearts: Ultra supercaps**](https://interestingengineering.com/could-ultracapacitors-replace-batteries-in-future-electric-vehicles) 

### Electric Charging Stations

Nothing much to say here, a charging station is a McDonald's for EVs. However, what are the revolutionary advancements? I would say the legendary OppCharge/Opportunity Charging!

## Software Technology

### Electric Charging Networks

Let's face it, we can easily find a charging station on Google Maps but with evergrowing services like car sharing, parking, what we require is a serious fully connected infrastructure. Well, BMW and Daimler's Your-Now says they're bringing together five of the world's most innovative urban mobility concepts under just one roof:
